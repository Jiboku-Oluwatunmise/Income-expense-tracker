# Income-expense-tracker
This is an excel spreadsheet which was created and designed by me during my time at Hankali Intel to help individuals and SMEs track their income and expenses respectively. 


The xlmx file contains the spreadsheet in 6 sections. These sections are grouped mainly into the income, the expenses, the analysis and the dashboard. 

The pdf shows the view of how the dashboard looks when the analysis is completed.
